-Problem-

Error: MongooseError: Operation `tours.insertOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms at Timeout

-or-

unhandledpromiserejectionwarning: unhandled promise rejection. this error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). to terminate the node process on unhandled promise rejection, use the cli flag `--unhandled-rejections=strict` (see https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode). (rejection id: 67)

-Solution-

If you keep timing out when trying to run mongoose commands (such as find),
you are not connected to the database before running the command. Check
your database connection. The unhandledpromiserejection is also coming from
findOne() not running in verifyRole
